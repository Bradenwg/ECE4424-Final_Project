This repository contains the code for three Machine Learning Modules used to complete my ECE 4424 final project.

Included in this repository are two example data files used as training and test data to train each model. 
Only two files are included, as the cumulative stock market data is too large to include. The full stock market dataset can be found at the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/borismarjanovic/price-volume-data-for-all-us-stocks-etfs
